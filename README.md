# Connect-Four-Game
This game was created based on the classic Connect Four game that kids play when they were younger. 

[Adapted from Wikipedia]: Connect Four (also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, Four in a Line, Drop Four, and Gravitrips (in Soviet Union)) is a two-player connection board game in which the players first choose a color (Note that in the game created, colors are already chosen for the users. To be specific, player A gets yellow while player B gets orange) and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

This game was created using pygame.
